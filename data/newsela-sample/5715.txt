Millipedes are long, skinny bugs. They like to coil up. In Latin, millipede means "thousand feet." They do not have that many feet, though. Most do not have more than 100 feet.
A new kind of millipede has more feet than usual. It comes closer to the "thousand feet" name. It was found living alone in a small California cave. It had 414 tiny legs.
The millipede might not look like much at first. It's a bit like a shoelace. It is less than one inch long.
Creature With 414 Legs
The scientists examined the millipede. They discovered it had 414 legs. They named it Illacme tobini.
The scientists sliced it open. They found 200 tiny holes along its body. The scientists believed the holes could leak out a poison. The poison helps the millipede protect itself.
Discovering the Illacme tobini was not easy. Biologists made many trips to caves in California. They searched from 2002 to 2004 first. They searched again from 2006 to 2009.
Only once did a biologist find the completely new animal. Biologist Jean K. Krejca was exploring a cave in 2006. She found a millipede. She saved it.
Two Animals Are Close Cousins
Then, Krejca sent the animal to a scientist named Paul Marek. Marek studies bugs. He found a close cousin of Illacme tobini the same year. It was called I. plenipes.
The I. plenipes was first seen in 1926. That millipede had 750 legs. It was the world record. Until Marek found it again, this animal had not been seen for 90 years. Marek and his team studied the millipedes. They found that both Marek's and the one Krejca sent were related.
There was no sign of another Illacme tobini between 2010 and 2012. Biologists took more trips. They combed 63 other places in California. It looks like the millipedes have disappeared again.
