Astronauts have fun exploring outer space. Something strange happens when they come home. The backs of their eyeballs are flatter. Their sight gets blurry. They might never be able to see like they once did. 
Many astronauts who fly in space for a long time have this problem. It is called VIIP. Scientists do not know why VIIP happens. One scientist wants to fix that.
Scientists Study The Problem
Noam Alperin is a scientist. He said that what is happening to astronauts' eyes is a big problem.
Alperin might know why VIIP happens. VIIP might be caused by the liquid around the brain. The liquid is also called fluid. Just like how you float while swimming, fluid floats in your brain. The fluid is important. It protects the brain. 
Alperin thinks that the fluid cannot float well in space. It cannot protect astronauts as well. 
Brain Pictures Can Help
Scientists took pictures of astronauts' brains. They took them before the astronauts went into space. More pictures were taken after they came back to Earth. The scientists compared the pictures. Some astronauts had flatter eyeballs.
The first person went into space about 50 years ago. There is still a lot we do not know. We do not know what space does to our bodies.
We need to study what happens to the body when we fly in space. That is not easy to do. Only a few people go into space. There are not many people to study.
