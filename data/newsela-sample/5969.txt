Some athletes are better than others. Do the best athletes simply practice more? One group of scientists says no. These scientists did a new study. The study showed that being the best in a sport takes a lot of practice. Still, the very best are not always the ones who worked the hardest or the most.
In 1993, a scientist did an important study. His name was K. Anders Ericsson. He studied human behavior and the human brain. Ericsson said that people who practiced more were better at what they did.
He first looked at people who played music. The more they practiced, Ericsson found, the better they were. He next looked at sports. The athletes who practiced most did better. With his study, he made a rule. It was called the “10,000-hour rule." The rule says that to be an expert at something, you have to put in 10,000 hours of work.
Practice Is Just One Part Of Success
Now, a new study is saying Ericsson might not have been completely right. The new study shows that practice is just part of becoming great at something. 
The new study was created by Brooke Macnamara and her team. They are also scientists like Ericsson.
They looked at 2,765 athletes. First, they looked at how many hours the athletes practiced. Then they looked at how good they were at their sport. Were they the fastest? Did they receive the highest score? 
More Understanding For Athletes
The scientists found that practice was important. They also found that the best athletes were not always the ones who practiced the most. Practice was not the only way to become great. 
Ericsson is not happy with the new study. He says the other scientists were defining “practice” differently than he did. Other scientists agreed. Some say the study did not help athletes or their coaches. 
Macnamara says the study does help. She says it gives a better understanding of how athletes work. She says we will probably never know everything. At least now, we know more.
