MOJAVE, Calif. — A company called Virgin Galactic is building a new rocket plane. The plane will travel into space. It is not just for scientists. Anyone will be able to buy a ticket.
On Friday, Virgin Galactic showed off the new spaceship. It is called SpaceShipTwo. The company will start testing it soon. 
SpaceShipTwo has two pilots. It carries up to six passengers. The spaceship will climb more than 62 miles into the air. For a few minutes, it will be at the edge of space. Passengers will float around weightless and look down at the Earth. 
Rocket Carried Aloft By Huge Airplane
The spaceship has some help getting off the ground. It is carried into the air by a huge airplane. The plane lets the spaceship go when it is about 45,000 feet off the ground. Then SpaceShipTwo's pilots start the rocket engine. This sends them flying toward space.
The spaceship then falls back down to Earth. Then it glides like a plane. It lands on a runway.
Virgin Galactic had been on hold since 2014. That year, the company was testing the first model of  SpaceShipTwo. It broke apart in the air. One of its two pilots died.
Pilot Error Contributed To Accident
Afterward, scientists tried to discover what had gone wrong. They found that pilot Michael Alsbury made a mistake. He made the spaceship start "feathering" too early. "Feathering" is how the spaceship slows down as it heads back to Earth. Small flaps pop out of the wings to slow it down.
Alsbury was killed in the crash. The other pilot, Peter Siebold, was able parachute to safety. He was badly injured.
Virgin Galactic said it would make sure the new spaceship is safe.
Company Will Conduct Many Tests
The company said it would do many tests of the new SpaceShipTwo. It would be careful before moving ahead. 
The company did not say when passengers will be able to take the plane. Testing might take some time.
SpaceShipTwo is a re-design of an earlier spaceship called SpaceShipOne. SpaceShipOne was a winged rocket plane that won the Ansari X Prize in 2004. The prize was given to the first spaceship that could take passengers on two trips to space within two weeks. Virgin Galactic won the prize of $10 million.
