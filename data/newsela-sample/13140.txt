NEW YORK, N.Y. — Back in 1999, a Japanese phone company released the very first emojis. Altogether there were 176 of the tiny digital designs. They included such things as smiley faces, hearts and cats.
At first, emojis were mainly popular in Japan. Today, they are used all over the world. 
On Wednesday, New York's Museum of Modern Art said it has been given the original set of 176 emojis. They were a gift from the phone company, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.
Old Emojis Will Be Shown With Some Of The Newest
The museum will show the emojis through the end of the year. They will appear on screens and will be shown together with some of the latest emojis.
Today, there are nearly 1,800 emojis. There are pictures of wine, a baby bottle, a dancing woman in a red dress, and, of course, poop. 
There have been fights over emojis. For example, some people were upset when Apple decided to change its gun symbol into a bright green toy pistol.
Emoji Faces Becoming More Diverse
The human faces in emoji have changed over time, as more non-white faces have been added. Over the summer, 11 new emojis showing working women were introduced.
Emojis continue to develop in ways that reflect our changing times. New ones are being added all the time.
The idea behind emojis goes back centuries. Emojis use a picture to represent a mood or idea, just like Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics or Chinese characters do. Emojis are completely modern, but they are timeless as well.
