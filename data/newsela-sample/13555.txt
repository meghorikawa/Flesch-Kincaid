Many people have a problem called obesity. It means they have too much body fat. Obesity can cause other health problems. Many black Americans have problems with obesity.
A new study on junk food commercials may explain why. The study was done by researchers. The researchers looked at TV watching in 2008 and 2012. In 2012, children sawÂ more soda and sugary drink commercials on TV.
The results also found a difference between black and white children. Black children were shown more junk food commercials.
Black Kids Saw 24 Junk Food TV Ads A Day
The new study also looked at older black kids. These kids were 12 years old and older. In 2008, they watched almost 19 snack and fast-food commercials a day. In 2012, the number went up. They watched 24 commercials a day.
There are too many TV ads for unhealthy foods. There must be fewer ads.
Nearly all these advertisements are for unhealthy food. Some are for junk food. Others are for fast food. Cara Shipley works to help obese black kids in Baltimore. She thinks they watch too many commercials, too. They can name every junk food cartoon character, she says.
Food Companies Deciding Which Foods Are Healthy
There is another problem. Many unhealthy foods are on a list that says which foods are healthy. Big food companies made this list. These foods have too much fat. There is too much sugar and salt, too. For 10 years, the companies have said they are fixing the problem. Not much has changed.
The food companies decide what is healthy. It decides what commercials will be on TV. Some experts think the government should get more involved. They should make rules. There are already rules for junk foods being advertised. The rules limit the advertisements to kids under 12 years old. Still, older kids see the commercials.
Today, sports and music stars are in junk-food ads. So new ads with famous people eating healthy foods are being made, too. Maybe some day eating healthy foods will be "cool."
