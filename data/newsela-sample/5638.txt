You can teach a dog to sit and roll over. But did you know you can teach an ape to paint?
Elephants, dolphins and birds can paint, too. Zoos sell the animals' paintings. People will pay a lot of money for art made by an animal. This helps pay for things the animals need.
The first famous animal painter was a chimp. His name was Congo. He painted on a TV show. Some of his paintings were beautiful. They sold for a lot of money.
An Enjoyable Time
Many animals that don't live in the wild are learning to paint, too. Their caretakers say painting is good for the animals. It keeps them from getting bored.
There are two gorillas at a zoo in Oklahoma. Their names are Gracie and Tatu. They learned to paint. Their caretaker gave them praise and food. This made Gracie and Tatu want to paint.
Caretaker Helps Create Artwork
The artwork is made by the caretaker and animal. The caretaker selects the colors and holds the paper. But sometimes the animal picks the colors and decides when the painting is done.
Painting could be the next skill you teach your pet. You can buy paint sets for dogs and cats. How will their artwork look next to yours?
