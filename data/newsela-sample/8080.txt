Chris McCain is a National Football League player. He plays for the Miami Dolphins. One day Chris came home from a vacation and received a phone call. The call was from one of his advisers. The adviser had bad news.
“You spent over $70,000 in one month,” Chris was told.
This was a big problem. Chris had just spent a large amount of his yearly salary. He was not thinking when he spent his money.
Chris is now much better at thinking about his money. He is not alone. Many NFL players are now better at it, too. 
Program Teaches Players About Money Management
Earlier this month, the NFL held a special event. This event was called the Personal Finance Academy. It was four days of classes about money. The NFL held this event for its players. Chris McCain was one of 28 players who went to the event.
These players went to many classes. They learned many lessons. The players learned how to spend their money wisely. They learned how to save their money for the future.
The players also learned how to help their families. They were told how to save money for their children and grandchildren.
Managing Money Isn't Easy
There was one other lesson to learn. That lesson was that managing money is hard. Some players might think that because they are good at football they are good at everything. That is not true. Thinking that way can cause players to make mistakes with their money. 
Chris made mistakes with his money. He learned from his mistakes.
Chris' vacation taught him to be more careful. He now knows not to spend so much money. He had to save some money instead. 
He is now doing just that. Chris saves his money. He even created a college savings account for his young daughter Malayla. Chris adds to this account every month.
“She was the one who opened up my eyes," Chris said about his daughter. Chris is now very smart with his money. He is thinking about the future.
