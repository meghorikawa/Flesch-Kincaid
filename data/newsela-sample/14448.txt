Many families have turkeys on their Thanksgiving tables. Thanksgiving is an American holiday. The turkeys Americans eat are not from the United States, though. They are American in a different way. Like many Americans, their ancestors came here from another country. 
Erin Thornton studies turkey farming. The turkeys we eat are originally from Mexico. They were taken to Europe by explorers. Europeans then brought them back to North America.
Turkeys Were For Feasts, Not Food
At first, turkeys were not used for food. They were used for religious and cultural events. This included things like parties and feasts.
The Spanish arrived in the Americas in the 1400s. By then turkeys were being eaten.
Camilla Speller studies the history of people. She says that the Spanish liked what they saw. They also enjoyed what they tasted. They shipped the first turkeys to Europe sometime around the year 1500. They were a huge hit in Europe. 
In Europe, Owning Turkeys Meant You Were Wealthy
Turkeys spread rapidly around Europe. People liked to have turkeys in their yards. It was a sign of wealth to have a turkey.
The first Thanksgiving happened in Plymouth, Massachusetts. It happened in the year 1621. It was a meal between Europeans who came to America and Native Americans.
Europeans brought animals with them to America. This included turkeys. The birds that were originally from Mexico came back to the Americas. 
Turkey Farmers Want Birds With Best Features
Today, people mate turkeys together. They want to create birds with the best features. They want to make turkeys better to eat. 
This actually makes the turkeys less healthy. It makes them all similar. Birds that are similar could be hurt by the same sicknesses. That means one sickness could hurt many of them. 
Some people want to preserve features of rare turkeys. They could be helpful in the future.
