There is new boat that needs a name. A contest let people choose. The winning name was Boaty McBoatface.
Not everyone is happy with that name. 
People in England were asked to name a boat. England is a country in Europe. The people voted. They said they wanted to name it Boaty McBoatface. The boat will take scientists to the coldest parts of the world. 
It Sounds Silly
Duncan Wingham is in the government in England. He will decide what to name the boat. Mr. Wingham has a problem. If he keeps the name Boaty McBoatface, scientists will not be happy. They think the name is silly.   
Many people think the government should keep the name Boaty McBoatface. Others do not. 
Bob Ward works for a science group at a university. He thinks the name should be Boaty McBoatface. He says that is what the people want. 
Picking A Name Was Fun
Tom Sheldon works for a news group. He also thinks Boaty McBoatface is a silly name. He says people will not be angry if another name is chosen. "We've had fun with this," he said.
The name Boaty McBoatface was James Hand's idea. He used to be on the radio. He said he was surprised that the name was causing problems.
Mr. Hand said he still thought Boaty McBoatface was a great name for the boat. But he did not vote for that name. He voted to name the boat something else.
Now people must decide what to name the new boat. Boaty McBoatface makes people smile. That might be nice for a ship.
