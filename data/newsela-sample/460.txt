TOKYO, Japan — Toyota Motor Corp., a Japanese automaker, has a new product. It's a robot called Kirobo Mini. This tiny robot can talk in a high-pitched voice. It doesn't do much else, though.
The Kirobo Mini looks like a little doll. It is 4 inches tall and costs 39,800 Japanese yen ($390). 
It's As Smart As A 5-Year-Old
Kirobo's name comes from two words. The first is the Japanese word "kibo," which means "hope." The second is the word "robot." Toyota says Kirobo is as smart as a 5-year-old child.
Fuminori Kataoka runs the Kirobo Mini project at Toyota. The robot does not have a lot of uses, but Kataoka says it can make people feel better. It is a companion robot. This type of robot is made to keep people company. A person can bring it with them wherever they go, like a good friend.
Turns Its Head Toward Your Voice
Kirobo Mini has a built-in camera and microphone. It can also connect to a smartphone. When someone speaks, Kirobo Mini turns its head toward the voice. Sometimes this does not work, though, because Kirobo is not very good at recognizing voices.
Kataoka showed the robot to a news reporter. Then he asked the robot its name. Kirobo Mini asked him what kind of car he had. Kataoka asked again. This time, Kirobo got the answer right. Kataoka just laughed. 
Can Help People Who Live Alone In Japan
Many people in Japan live alone. Some are very old. Others are young and not married. These people need someone, or something, to talk to, Kataoka said. 
He did not pretend that the robot has many uses. Still, he thinks people who live alone will like Kirobo Mini. It will give them something to talk to. Kataoka said it's kind of like talking to a stuffed animal. An ordinary toy can't talk back. Kirobo can, though.
Companion robots are already used by some in Japan. There are a few companies that make these human-like robots. Softbank is one. It makes a robot called Pepper. Pepper can ask and answer questions. It even knows when someone is happy or sad. 
Future Uses for Human-Like Robots
Honda Motor Co., another Japanese automaker, also makes a robot. It's called Asimo. It can can run, pick things up, and talk.
Car companies aren't just making smart robots. They're also trying to make smart cars. These smart cars could be self-driving. 
Could Kirobo Mini work with a car one day? Toyota did not say.
For now, Kirobo will just go along for the ride. Toyota said Kirobo might know when a car has stopped very suddenly. Then, it might say, "Oh, oh, oh, oh. Be careful." On a long drive, Kirobo might say, "Let's take a break!"
