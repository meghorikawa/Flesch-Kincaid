MOUNT BAKER, Wash. — Walker Smith is a skier. He is 17 years old. Walker slides over the snow on two long boards. He skis down mountains. Walker has skied since he was a child. He has always skied inside the trail at ski mountains. It is safer there. Now he wants to ski outside the trails.
Many young people ski, snowboard or hike in the winter. They are doing all of these things outside the trails. They are going out in the backcountry. It is usually less safe. Still, young people like the fun. Teachers want young people to know about avalanches. Snow and ice can suddenly fall down a mountain. More people get hurt in the backcountry. At least 14 people have died in avalanches this winter.
Learning When To Be Careful
Walker is from Seattle. It is a city in the state of Washington. He knows the backcountry is more dangerous. Walker and other teenagers want to know how to stay safe. They take a trip to the backcountry. The teens will learn about avalanches. They will learn from an avalanche safety group. 
Eric Gullickson is a teacher with the group. He points out rolling snow balls. The little balls mean the snow is wet and shaky. It could slide down the mountain. Eric asks the group about the snow at ski mountains. The teens say many people step on it. They squish it so the snow becomes safe. People do not squish the snow in the backcountry. The snow there is less safe. The young people know they have to be careful.
Being Backcountry Safe
Eric and his group teach young students to be safe in the backcountry. They want people to learn about avalanches when they are young. Then they will have the skills when they are older.
