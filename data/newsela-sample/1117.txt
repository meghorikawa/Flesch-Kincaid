Comets are big balls of ice and dust that travel through space. Scientists have been studying one comet for almost two years. It is known as 67P.
The scientists have been looking for signs of life. So far, they have not found any. 
They have found something almost as important, though.
It turns out the comet has everything needed for life to begin.
Glycine Present On Comet 67P
The find was made by the Rosetta orbiter. An orbiter is a spaceship with no people on it. It takes pictures and sends messages back to Earth.
The most important thing the orbiter found is glycine.
Glycine is a molecule. A molecule is a group of atoms joined together.
Atoms are in everything. They are the tiny building blocks that make up all matter.
Glycine joins with other molecules to build proteins. These form body parts like muscle and hair. Without proteins, there is no life.
The glycine on 67P was spotted by ROSINA, a special machine. ROSINA is one of the tools on the Rosetta orbiter. Kathrin Altwegg is a scientist. She is in charge of looking at what ROSINA finds.
Everything Needed For Life
67P has several other things needed for life. ROSINA also spotted phosphorus, oxygen, alcohol and sugar. With glycine, these things make life possible. Only water and heat need to be added.
67P has everything needed for life, Altwegg said. Never before have all these things been found in one place. Until now, only Earth appeared to have them all.
Altwegg says there may be many more comets like 67P. Glycine could be quite common in space.
Some scientists think a comet might have crashed into Earth many years ago. It may have brought glycine and other things needed for life. Before it arrived, Earth was empty.
This may be how life on Earth began. If it is, there may be life on other planets, too.
